package main

// Declare a generic type named stack that uses a struct with a single
// field named data declared as a slice of some type T.

// Declare a method named push that accepts a value of some type T and appends
// the value to the slice.

// Declare a method named pop that returns the latest value of some type T
// that was appended to the slice and an error.

func main() {

	// Constructs a value of type stack that stores integers.

	// Push the values of 10 and 20 to the stack.

	// Pop a value from the stack.

	// Print the value that was popped.

	// Pop another value from the stack.

	// Print the value that was popped.

	// Pop another value from the stack. This should
