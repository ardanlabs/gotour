## http/pprof Profiling

Using the http/pprof support you can profile your web applications and services to see exactly where your performance or memory is being taken.

### Building and Running the Project

We have a website that we will use to learn and explore more about profiling. This project is just creating a struct type value, marshaling it to JSON and using that as the response.

Build and run the example program.

	$ go build
	$ ./pprof

Test it is working.

	http://localhost:4000/sendjson

To add load to the service while running profiling we can run these command.

	// Send 1M request using 8 connections.
	$ hey -m POST -c 8 -n 1000000 "http://localhost:4000/sendjson"

### Raw http/pprof

We already added the following import so we can include the profiling route to our web service.

	import _ "net/http/pprof"

Look at the basic profiling stats from the new endpoint.

	http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof

Run a single search from the Browser and then refresh the profile information.

	http://localhost:4000/sendjson

Put some load of the web application. Review the raw profiling information once again.

	$ hey -m POST -c 8 -n 1000000 "http://localhost:4000/sendjson"

### Looking at Heap Profiles

	http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/heap?debug=1

At the top of the heap profile you will see this information.

	heap profile: 0: 0 [9318: 3545424] @ heap/1048576
	[0:] 		    Currently live objects,
	[0] 		    Amount of memory occupied by live objects
	[9318:] 	    Total number of allocations
	[3545424] 	    Amount of memory occupied by all allocations

At the bottom of the heap profile you will see this information.

General statistics.

	Alloc      uint64 // bytes allocated and not yet freed
	TotalAlloc uint64 // bytes allocated (even if freed)
	Sys        uint64 // bytes obtained from system (sum of XxxSys below)
	Lookups    uint64 // number of pointer lookups
	Mallocs    uint64 // number of mallocs
	Frees      uint64 // number of frees

Main allocation heap statistics.

	HeapAlloc    uint64 // bytes allocated and not yet freed (same as Alloc above)
	HeapSys      uint64 // bytes obtained from system
	HeapIdle     uint64 // bytes in idle spans
	HeapInuse    uint64 // bytes in non-idle span
	HeapReleased uint64 // bytes released to the OS
	HeapObjects  uint64 // total number of allocated objects

Low-level fixed-size structure allocator statistics.

	// Inuse is bytes used now.
	// Sys is bytes obtained from system.
	StackInuse  uint64 // bytes used by stack allocator
	StackSys    uint64
	MSpanInuse  uint64 // mspan structures
	MSpanSys    uint64
	MCacheInuse uint64 // mcache structures
	MCacheSys   uint64
	BuckHashSys uint64 // profiling bucket hash table
	GCSys       uint64 // GC metadata
	OtherSys    uint64 // other system allocations

Garbage collector statistics.

	NextGC  uint64 // next collection will happen when HeapAlloc â‰¥ this amount
	PauseNs [256]uint64 // circular buffer of recent GC pause durations, most recent at [(NumGC+255)%256]
	NumGC   uint32 // Number of GC that have run

### Interactive Profiling

#### Heap Profiling

Run the pprof tool.

	$ go tool pprof -<PICK_MEM_PROFILE> ./pprof http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/heap

Documentation of memory profile options.

	// Useful to see pressure on heap over time.
	-alloc_space  : All allocations happened since program start  	** default
	-alloc_objects: Number of object allocated at the time of profile

    // Useful to see current status of heap.
	-inuse_space  : Allocations live at the time of profile
	-inuse_objects: Number of bytes allocated at the time of profile

If you want to reduce memory consumption, look at the `-inuse_space` profile collected during normal program operation.
	
If you want to improve execution speed, look at the `-alloc_objects` profile collected after significant running time or at program end.

#### CPU Profiling

Run the Go pprof tool in another window or tab to review cpu information.

	$ go tool pprof http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/profile

If you include the binary when using the browser tooling, you can get informatio down to the assembly.

	$ go tool pprof -http :3000 ./pprof http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/profile

_Note that goroutines in "syscall" state consume an OS thread, other goroutines do not (except for goroutines that called runtime.LockOSThread, which is, unfortunately, not visible in the profile)._

_Note that goroutines in "IO wait" state do NOT consume an OS thread. They are parked on the non-blocking network poller._

Explore using the **top**, **list**, **web** and **weblist** commands from the command line. If you are using the browser based UI, these items on in the navigation.

### Comparing Profiles

Take a snapshot of the current heap profile. Then do the same for the cpu profile.

    $ curl -s http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/heap > base.heap

After some time, take another snapshot:

    $ curl -s http://localhost:4000/debug/pprof/heap > current.heap

Now compare both snapshots against the binary and get into the pprof tool:

    $ go tool pprof -inuse_space -base base.heap current.heap
