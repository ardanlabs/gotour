Welcome
Welcome to the Ultimate Go tour. Learn more about the tour before you start.

* Hello, 世界

.play welcome/hello.go

Welcome to a tour of the [[/][Go programming language]].

The tour is divided into a list of modules that you can
access by clicking on
[[javascript:highlight(".logo")][Ultimate Go]] on the top left of the page.

You can also view the table of contents at any time by clicking on the [[javascript:highlightAndClick(".nav")][menu]] on the top right of the page.

Throughout the tour you will find a series of slides and exercises for you
to complete.

You can navigate through them using

- [[javascript:highlight(".prev-page")]["previous"]] or `PageUp` to go to the previous page,

- [[javascript:highlight(".next-page")]["next"]] or `PageDown` to go to the next page.

The tour is interactive. Click the
[[javascript:highlightAndClick("#run")][Run]] button now
(or press `Shift` + `Enter`) to compile and run the program on
#appengine: a remote server.
your computer.
The result is displayed below the code.

These example programs demonstrate different aspects of Go. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.

Edit the program and run it again.

When you click on [[javascript:highlightAndClick("#format")][Format]]
(shortcut: `Ctrl` + `Enter`), the text in the editor is formatted using the
[[/cmd/gofmt/][gofmt]] tool. You can switch syntax highlighting on and off
by clicking on the [[javascript:highlightAndClick(".syntax-checkbox")][syntax]] button.

When you're ready to move on, click the [[javascript:highlightAndClick(".next-page")][right arrow]] below or type the `PageDown` key.

* Go offline (optional)

This tour is also available as a stand-alone program that you can use without access to the internet. It builds and runs the code samples on your own machine.

To run the tour locally, you'll need to first [[https://go.dev/doc/install][install Go]] and then run:

    go install github.com/ardanlabs/gotour/cmd/tour@latest

This will place a tour binary in your [[https://go.dev/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_and_Modules][GOPATH's]] bin directory. When you run the tour program, it will open a web browser displaying your local version of the tour.

Of course, you can continue to take the tour through this web site.

* The Go Playground

.play welcome/sandbox.go

This tour is built atop the [[https://play.golang.org/][Go Playground]], a web service that runs on [[https://go.dev/][golang.org's]] servers.

The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.

There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:

In the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.
There are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage, and the program cannot access external network hosts.
The playground uses the latest stable release of Go.

* Contribute To The Project

*How* *To* *Get* *Started*

If you are interested in adding more sections or content to the project, please
add an issue to the repo. Just provide a general idea for the content you want
to add and why. If you already have a code example, please share.

[[https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotour][https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotour]]

We will discuss the issue and if approved, you can submit a PR. We would
love more examples and topics under algorithms.

*New* *Languages*

We would also love to have the content translated in different languages.
If you are interested, please add an issue. We can compensate for this
effort.

** Our Experience

We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There
is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to
help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know
what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing
software in Go.

Our classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few
months to years of experience writing code in Go. Our classes provide a very deep
knowledge of the programming language with a big push on language mechanics, design
philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority
on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. We cover a lot about “if
performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design,
decoupling and writing/debugging production software.

** Our Teacher

William Kennedy is a managing partner at Ardan Labs in Miami, Florida. Ardan Labs
is a high-performance development and training firm working with startups and
fortune 500 companies. He is also a co-author of the book Go in Action, the author
of the blog GoingGo.Net, and a founding member of GoBridge which is working to
increase Go adoption through diversity.

** More About Go

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages,
it has a unique and simple nature that make Go programs different in character from
programs written in other languages. It balances the capabilities of a low-level
systems language with some high-level features you see in modern languages today.
This creates a programming environment that allows you to be incredibly productive,
performant and fully in control; in Go, you can write less code and do so much more.

Go is the fusion of performance and productivity wrapped in a language that software
developers can learn, use and understand. Go is not C, yet we have many of the
benefits of C with the benefits of higher level programming languages.

** Important Reading

Please check out this page of [[https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/blob/master/reading/README.md][important reading]].
You will find articles and videos around mechanical sympathy, data-oriented design,
Go runtime and optimizations and articles about the history of computing.

** Joining the Go Slack Community

We use a slack channel to share links, code, and examples during the training.
