Integrity matters and it’s a big part of the engineering process. At the heart of
integrity is error handling. When it comes to Go, error handling is not an exception
to be handled later or somewhere else in the code. It’s a part of the main path and
needs to be a main focus.

Developers have the responsibility to return enough context about any error so a
user can make an informed decision about how to proceed. Handling an error is
about three things: logging the error, not propagating the error any further, and
determining if the Goroutine/program needs to be terminated.

In Go, errors are just values so they can be anything you need them to be. They
can maintain any state or behavior.

** Error Handling Basics

The error interface is built into the language. 

    // https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#error
    type error interface {
        Error() string
    }

This is why it appears to be an unexported identifier. Any concrete value that
implements this interface can be used as an error value.

One important aspect of Go is that error handling is done in a decoupled state
through this interface. A key reason for this is because error handling is an
aspect of my application that is more susceptible to change and improvement.
This interface is the type Go applications must use as the return type for error
handling.

    // https://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
    type errorString struct {
        s string
    }

    // https://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
    func (e *errorString) Error() string {
        return e.s
    }

This is the most commonly used error value in Go programs. It’s declared in the
errors package from the standard library. Notice how the type is unexported and
it has one unexported field which is a string. You can also see how pointer semantics
are used to implement the error interface. This means only addresses to values
of this type can be shared and stored inside the interface. The method just returned
the error string.

It’s important to remember, the implementation of the Error method serves the
purpose of implementing the interface and for logging. If any user needs to parse
the string returned from this method, You have failed to provide the user the
right amount of context to make an informed decision.

    // https://golang.org/src/pkg/errors/errors.go
    func New(text string) error {
        return &errorString{text}
    }

The New function is how an error using the concrete type errorString is constructed.
Notice how the function returns the error using the error interface. Also notice
how pointer semantics are being used. 

    func main() {
        if err := webCall(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }
        fmt.Println("Life is good")
    }

    func webCall() error {
        return New("bad request")
    }

Context is everything with errors. Each error must provide enough context to allow
the caller to make an informed decision about the state of the goroutine/application.
In this example, the webCall function returns an error with the message Bad Request.
In the main function, a call is made to webCall and then a check is made to see
if an error has occurred with the call.

    if err := webCall(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

The key to the check is err != nil. What this condition is asking is, is there a
concrete value stored inside the err interface value. When the interface value is
storing a concrete value, there is an error. In this case, the context is literally
just the fact that a concrete value exists, it’s not important what the concrete
value is.

What if it’s important to know what error value exists inside the err interface
variable? Then error variables are a good option.

    var (
        ErrBadRequest = errors.New("Bad Request")
        ErrPageMoved = errors.New("Page Moved")
    )

Error variables provide a mechanic to identify what specific error is being returned.
They have an idiom of starting with the prefix Err and are based on the concrete type
errorString from the errors package.

    func webCall(b bool) error {
        if b {
            return ErrBadRequest
        }
        return ErrPageMoved
    }

In this new version of webCall, the function returns one or the other error variable.
This allows the caller to determine which error took place.

    func main() {
        if err := webCall(true); err != nil {
            switch err {
            case ErrBadRequest:
                fmt.Println("Bad Request Occurred")
                return

            case ErrPageMoved:
                fmt.Println("The Page moved")
                return

            default:
                fmt.Println(err)
                return
            }
        }

        fmt.Println("Life is good")
    }

In the application after the call to webCall is made, a check can be performed to
see if there is a concrete value stored inside the err interface variable. If there
is, then a switch statement is used to determine which error it was by comparing err
to the different error variables.

In this case, the context of the error is based on which error variable was returned.
What if an error variable is not enough context? What if some special state needs
to be checked, like with networking errors? In these cases, a custom concrete error
type is the answer.

    type UnmarshalTypeError struct {
        Value string
        Type  reflect.Type
    }

    func (e *UnmarshalTypeError) Error() string {
        return "json: cannot unmarshal " + e.Value +
            " into Go value of type " + e.Type.String()
    }

This is a custom concrete error type implemented in the json package. Notice the
name has a suffix of Error in the naming of the type. Also notice the use of
pointer semantics for the implementation of the error interface. Once again the
implementation is for logging and should display information about all the fields
being captured.

    type InvalidUnmarshalError struct {
        Type reflect.Type
    }

    func (e *InvalidUnmarshalError) Error() string {
        if e.Type == nil {
            return "json: Unmarshal(nil)"
        }
        if e.Type.Kind() != reflect.Ptr {
            return "json: Unmarshal(non-pointer " + e.Type.String() + ")"
        }
        return "json: Unmarshal(nil " + e.Type.String() + ")"
    }

This is a second custom concrete error type found in the json package. The implementation
of the Error method is a bit more complex, but once again just for logging and
using pointer semantics.

    func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error {
        rv := reflect.ValueOf(v)
        if rv.Kind() != reflect.Ptr || rv.IsNil() {
            return &InvalidUnmarshalError{reflect.TypeOf(v)}
        }
        return &UnmarshalTypeError{"string", reflect.TypeOf(v)}
    }

Here is a portion of the Unmarshal function. Notice how it constructs the concrete
error values in the return, passing them back to the caller through the error interface.
Pointer semantic construction is being used because pointer semantics were used in
the declaration of the Error method.

The context of the error here is more about the type of error stored inside the
error interface. There needs to be a way to determine that.

    func main() {
        var u user
        err := Unmarshal([]byte(`{"name":"bill"}`), u)
        if err != nil {
            switch e := err.(type) {
            case *UnmarshalTypeError:
                fmt.Printf("UnmarshalTypeError: Value[%s] Type[%v]\n",
                    e.Value, e.Type)
            case *InvalidUnmarshalError:
                fmt.Printf("InvalidUnmarshalError: Type[%v]\n", e.Type)
            default:
                fmt.Println(err)
            }
            return
        }
        fmt.Println("Name:", u.Name)
    }

A generic type assertion within the scope of the switch statement is how you can
write code to test what type of value is being stored inside the err interface value.
Type is the context here and now you can test and take action with access to all
the states of the error.

However, this poses one problem. I’m no longer decoupled from the concrete error
value. This means if the concrete error value is changed, my code can break. The
beautiful part of using an interface for error handling is being decoupled from
breaking changes.

If the concrete error value has a method set, then you can use an interface for
the type check. As an example, the net package has many concrete error types that
implement different methods. One common method is called Temporary. This method
allows the user to test if the networking error is critical or just something
that can recover on its own.

    type temporary interface {
        Temporary() bool
    }

    func (c *client) BehaviorAsContext() {
        for {
            line, err := c.reader.ReadString('\n')
            if err != nil {
                switch e := err.(type) {
                case temporary:
                    if !e.Temporary() {
                        log.Println("Temporary: Client leaving chat")
                        return
                    }
                default:
                    if err == io.EOF {
                        log.Println("EOF: Client leaving chat")
                        return
                    }
                    log.Println("read-routine", err)
                }
            }
            fmt.Println(line)
        }
    }

In this code, the call to ReadString could fail with an error from the net package.
In this case, an interface is declared that represents the common behavior a given
concrete error value could implement. Then with a generic type assertion, you test
if that behavior exists and you can call into it. The best part, you stay in a
decoupled state with my error handling.

** Always Use The Error Interface

One mistake Go developers can make is when they use the concrete error type and
not the error interface for the return type for handling errors. If you were to
do this, bad things could happen.

    type customError struct{}

    func (c *customError) Error() string {
        return "Find the bug."
    }

    func fail() ([]byte, *customError) {
        return nil, nil
    }

    func main() {
        var err error
        if _, err = fail(); err != nil {
            log.Fatal("Why did this fail?")
        }
        log.Println("No Error")
    }

Output:
    
    Why did this fail?

Why does this code think there is an error when the fail function returns nil for
the error? It’s because the fail function is using the concrete error type and not
the error interface. In this case, there is a nil pointer of type customError stored
inside the err variable. That is not the same as a nil interface value of type error.

** Handling Errors

Handling errors is more of a macro level engineering conversation. In my world, error
handling means the error stops with the function handling the error, the error is
logged with full context, and the error is checked for its severity. Based on the
severity and ability to recover, a decision to recover, move on, or shutdown is made.

One problem is that not all functions can handle an error. One reason could be because
not all functions are allowed to log. What happens when an error is being passed back
up the call stack and can’t be handled by the function receiving it? An error needs to
be wrapped in context so the function that eventually handles it, can properly do so.

    package main

    import (
        "errors"
        "fmt"
    )

    type AppError struct {
        State int
    }

    func (ae *AppError) Error() string {
        return fmt.Sprintf("App Error, State: %d", ae.State)
    }

    func IsAppError(err error) bool {
        var ae *AppError
        return errors.As(err, &ae)
    }

    func GetAppError(err error) *AppError {
        var ae *AppError
        if !errors.As(err, &ae) {
            return nil
        }
        return ae
    }

    func main() {
        if err := firstCall(10); err != nil {

            // Check if the error is an AppError.
            if IsAppError(err) {
                ae := GetAppError(err)
                fmt.Printf("Is AppError, State: %d\n", ae.State)
            }

            fmt.Print("\n********************************\n\n")

            // Display the error using the implementation of
            // the error interface.
            fmt.Printf("%v\n", err)
        }
    }

    func firstCall(i int) error {
        if err := secondCall(i); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("secondCall(%d) : %w", i, err)
        }
        return nil
    }

    func secondCall(i int) error {
        return &AppError{99}
    }

Output:

    Is AppError, State: 99

    ********************************

    secondCall(10) : App Error, State: 99

** Notes

- Use the default error value for static and simple formatted messages.
- Create and return error variables to help the caller identify specific errors.
- Create custom error types when the context of the error is more complex.
- Error Values in Go aren't special, they are just values like any other, and so you have the entire language at your disposal.

* Exercises

Use the template as a starting point to complete the exercises. A possible solution is provided.

** Exercise 1

Create two error variables, one called ErrInvalidValue and the other called
ErrAmountTooLarge. Provide the static message for each variable. Then write a
function called checkAmount that accepts a float64 type value and returns an
error value. Check the value for zero and if it is, return the ErrInvalidValue.
Check the value for greater than $1,000 and if it is, return the ErrAmountTooLarge.
Write a main function to call the checkAmount function and check the return error
value. Display a proper message to the screen.

** Exercise 2

Create a custom error type called appError that contains three fields, err error,
message string and code int. Implement the error interface providing your own message
using these three fields. Implement a second method named temporary that returns
false when the value of the code field is 9. Write a function called checkFlag that
accepts a bool value. If the value is false, return a pointer of your custom error
type initialized as you like. If the value is true, return a default error. Write a
main function to call the checkFlag function and check the error using the temporary
interface.
