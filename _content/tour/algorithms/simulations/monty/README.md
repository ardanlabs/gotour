# Monty Hall

The [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) states:

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

We'll run a simulation where we pick random door with a car and random door for the player. Then calculate how many times the "stay" strategy won the game and how many times the "switch" strategy won.
