# Sick or Not?

The following question is taken from Nassim Taleb's [Fooled By Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219) book which I highly recommend.

> The test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives. The disease strikes 1/1000 of the population. People are tested at random, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the disease. A patientâ€™s test is positive. What is the probability of the patient being stricken with the disease?
